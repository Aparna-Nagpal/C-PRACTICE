/*
JUDGING DELAY difficulty rating:964
You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.
There are N submissions, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th submission was submitted at time Si and judged at time Ji(in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 5 minutes.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Si and Ji.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.
