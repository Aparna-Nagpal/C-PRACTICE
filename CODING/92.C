THE HIDDEN NUMBERS difficulty rating:917
Salmon has some hidden numbers that he wants you to find!
Given an integer N, find and output any two integers A and B such that:1≤A,B≤10  , and A∗B=N.
###Input: The first line of input consists of a single integer 1≤T≤10 - the number of testcases.
The next T lines will consist of one integer, 1≤ N≤10 .
###Output: For each of the T testcases, output two space-separated integers A and B.
