FLIP THE CARDS
There are N cards on a table, out of which X cards are face-up and the remaining are face-down.
In one operation, we can do the following:
Select any one card and flip it (i.e. if it was initially face-up, after the operation, it will be face-down and vice versa)
What is the minimum number of operations we must perform so that all the cards face in the same direction (i.e. either all are face-up or all are face-down)?
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X — the total number of cards and the number of cards which are initially face-up.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of cards you must flip so that all the cards face in the same direction.
