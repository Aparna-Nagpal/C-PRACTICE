RAIN IN CHEFLAND 328
In Chefland, precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour.
Chef categorises rainfall as:
LIGHT, if rainfall is less than 3 millimetre per hour.
MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to 3 millimetre per hour and less than 7 millimetre per hour.
HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to 7 millimetre per hour.
Given that it rains at X millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X â€” the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

You may print each character in lowercase or uppercase. For example, LIGHT, light, Light, and liGHT, are all identical.
